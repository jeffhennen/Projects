Instructions:

    • In Visual Studio Code, write the code that accomplishes the objectives listed below and
         ensures that the code compiles and runs as directed.

    • Create a new repository on GitHub for this week’s assignments and push this document,
         with your project code, to the repository.

    • Include the URLs for this week’s repository and video where instructed.
    • Submit this document as a .PDF file in the LMS.

Coding Steps:

    • Create a website using only HTML. The website can be anything you like (within school
         guidelines) if it meets the following criteria:
             • At least 3 pages with links to navigate between all pages present on each page.
             • 2 different size headers, list, 3 images, table, and a form.

Video Steps:

    • Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works
         with an emphasis on the portions you contributed.

    • This video should be done using screen share and voice over.
    • This can easily be done using Zoom, although you don't have to use Zoom, it's just what

         we recommend.
             o You can create a new meeting, start screen sharing, and start recording.
             o This will create a video recording on your computer.

    • This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube.
             o Ensure the link you share is PUBLIC or UNLISTED!
             o If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what
                  they can access.
